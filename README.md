# Tetris

Implementation of Tetris clone from scratch in Python using Pygame. Fully functional, but I'm still customizing it.

Controls:
- Move with Left, Right, Down arrow keys
- Rotate with Up (clockwise) or D (clockwise) and S (counterclockwise)
- Store/retrieve blocks with F
- HardDrop with Space
- Escape to pause
- Restart (R) and Quit (Q), only from Pause and GameOver screens
